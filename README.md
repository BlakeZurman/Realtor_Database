# Realtor_Database
This project demonstrates my knowledge of implementing a relational database model. 
The chosen topic for this project was to create a Database that demonstrates my understanding of SQL functions including:
- Transitioning from a logical model to SQL script.
- Deisgning useful procedures to insert data, and pull data.
- Implementing index's to improve preformance of the model.

This repository includes the conceptual model, the logical model, and all the SQL scripts for this database to function. It does not require any packages, or CSV files.
