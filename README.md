# Realtor_Database
This project demonstrates my knowledge of implementing a relational database model. The chosen topic for this project was to create a Database that demonstrates my understanding of SQL functions including:
    - Transitioning from a logical model to SQL script.
    - Deisgning useful procedures to insert data, and pull data.
    - Implementing index's to improve preformance of the model.
