# Realtor_Database
This project demonstrates my knowledge of implementing a relational database model. 
The chosen topic for this project was to create a Database that demonstrates my understanding of SQL functions including:
- Transitioning from a logical model to SQL script.
- Deisgning useful procedures to insert data, and pull data.
- Implementing index's to improve preformance of the model.
    
## Repostory_Contents ##
This repository includes the conceptual model, the logical model, and all the SQL scripts for this database to function. It does not require any packages, or CSV files.

### Conceptual Model ###

This model has base entities including *Client, Agent, Office, and Property.* The other entities, *Appointment & Sale* are connected to these key entites using appropriate cardinality. It was my goal in creating this conceptual model to keep things simpleand expandable while ensuring good practice. Most importantly, this model is designed in a way that anyone can understand. It is my belief that my strong foundation in the fundementals of database modeling are of value to any business.

### Logical Model ###

This logical model implements all the ideas from the conceptual model and visually shows all foreign keys.
